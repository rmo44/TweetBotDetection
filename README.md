# Twitter Bot Detector

This project is a full-stack web application that uses a fine-tuned BERT model to classify whether a tweet or social media post was generated by a human or a bot.

Built using:
- HuggingFace Transformers + PyTorch (backend)
- Flask API for model serving
- React for the frontend UI

## Demo

<img src="screenshot.png" alt="Bot Detector UI Screenshot" width="600"/>

To see the demo in action, enter a sample tweet into the input field and observe the classification results displayed below the form. The prediction will indicate whether the text is likely from a human or a bot, along with a confidence score.

## Features

- Input any tweet or post and classify it as "Human" or "Bot"
- Displays prediction confidence from the fine-tuned BERT model
- Full local model execution — no external API calls required
- Simple, clean user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Flask backend serves the model and handles prediction requests

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/rmo44/TweetBotDetection.git
- cd TweetBotDetection

### 2. Important file set up
- A piece of our model file was too big to upload onto Github
- Please download the model.zip() file from google drive and save it under the following folder: bert-twitterbot-detector
- This is the file path to that folder:TweetBotDetection/tweetbot/backend/bert-twitterbot-detector


### 2. Set up the Python backend (using Conda recommended)
- cd backend
- conda create -n botdetector python=3.10 -y
- conda activate botdetector
- pip install -r ../requirements.txt

Then run the Flask API server:
- python app.py

### 3. Set up the React frontend
Open a new terminal window or tab:
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm start

## BERT Model Details

The classification model used in this project is a fine-tuned version of `bert-base-uncased` from HuggingFace. It has been trained specifically to distinguish between human-written and bot-generated social media posts.

Model characteristics:
- Architecture: `BertForSequenceClassification`
- Task: Binary classification (`Human` = 0, `Bot` = 1)
- Max token length: 128
- Tokenizer: BERT tokenizer with standard `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, and `[PAD]` tokens

All model weights and tokenizer configuration files are stored locally in the `backend/bert-twitterbot-detector/` directory. No internet access is required at runtime.

## Example Input

You can test the classifier by entering any tweet-style text. Here's an example:

**Input:**
Just had an amazing dinner with friends! #blessed

**Output:**
- Prediction: Human  
- Confidence: 96.42%

Another example:

**Input:**
Check out our new crypto investment platform! Get rich quick: http://scam.link

**Output:**
- Prediction: Bot  
- Confidence: 92.10%

## .gitignore Best Practices

The repository includes a `.gitignore` file to prevent unnecessary or large files from being tracked by Git. This helps keep the repository lightweight and ensures only the essential source code and configuration files are committed.

Ignored files and directories include:

- `frontend/node_modules/` — local frontend dependencies
- `.conda/`, `env/`, `venv/` — local virtual environments
- `*.safetensors`, `*.bin`, `*.pth` — large model weight files
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db` — OS-generated junk files
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/` — editor-specific settings

## To Do / Possible Extensions

This project provides a solid base for bot detection using NLP, but there are several enhancements that can be made:

- [ ] Integrate live Twitter scraping for real-time detection
- [ ] Deploy backend and frontend using Docker or Render
- [ ] Display attention visualizations or model explainability (e.g., SHAP or LIME)
